# MakeMyTrip-Automation-Train-Reservation
The MakeMyTrip Railways Automation project is designed to automate the train booking process on the MakeMyTrip website. Leveraging the Selenium framework with Java in Eclipse IDE, this script streamlines the booking procedure by systematically navigating the website, selecting travel details, and initiating a search.
